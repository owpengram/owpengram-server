-- Restrict a catalog gift to official-support accounts only. The flag lives on
-- the immutable catalog revision (like require_premium) and is enforced at the
-- RPC purchase boundary: buyers without the support account flag are treated as
-- sold out (STARGIFT_USAGE_LIMITED on sendStarsForm, sold-out ResultFail on
-- checkCanSendGift) and cannot form an auction bid (STARGIFT_INVALID).
