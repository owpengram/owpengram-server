// Admin API authorisation.
//
// Every request arrives with a bearer token, and the token decides which
// permissions the request carries:
//
//   - TELESRV_ADMIN_API_TOKEN is the master token and carries every permission.
//     This is what keeps the existing surface working unchanged: all the routes
//     that predate permissions stay mounted through authenticated(), which is
//     defined as "requires every permission", so the master token reaches them
//     exactly as before.
//   - A scoped token from TELESRV_ADMIN_SCOPED_TOKENS carries only the
//     permissions its entry lists. A scoped token is therefore *not* a weaker
//     master token: it authenticates successfully and is then refused with 403 on
//     anything outside its list, including every legacy route. Widening a scoped
//     token to the legacy surface would be a silent privilege escalation, so the
//     wildcard has to be spelled out in configuration to get it.
//
// The two-step answer matters for diagnosis: 401 means "I do not know this
// token", 403 means "I know you and you may not do this".

// Permission names. They are the same strings the operator writes into
// TELESRV_ADMIN_UI_PERMISSIONS / TELESRV_ADMIN_SCOPED_TOKENS.
